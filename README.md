# RC-CAR
RC-CAR control by smartphone 
This  project works like the following:
-Once the RC-CAR starts, we see the Bluetooth LED flashing, knowing that the Arduino bluetooth application already installed on your smartphone, we launch the application and connect it to the bluetooth of the car without forgetting the settings of the parameter of the application.we have a change of blinking when the bluetooth would be connected
-At the start we have LEDs which are on (the front one), and always remain on, once we turn right we have two LEDs which will light up (one forward on the right and back on the right), likewise if you turn left will light up (one forward on the left and backward on the left), if you go backwards you also have two rear LEDs, one on the left and the other on the right, will light up
